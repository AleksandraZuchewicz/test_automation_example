Protractor is used for automation test for Angular applications via real word browser. 
Protractor is build on the top of WebDriwerJS and nodeJS 

we should be aware that webDriwer and nodejs are asynchronous by itself, but since WebdruwerJS is based on Promise, it in 
it in turn is wrapped around what is called as Webdriver constrol flow. 

Protractor adaptation: 
Protractor adapts Jasmine so that each spec automatically waits until the constrol flow is empty before exiting

Jasmine expectation are alse adapt to understand promises. Thats why this line works - the code actually adds 
an exception task to the control flow, which will run after the other tasks 

so, promise manager are made our debugging to not happen, since this expect us to fulfil an promise before moving forward. 

in future release neither promise manager or control flow are going to there with Protractor or webdrower, 
since control flow is set to be removed, instread of thre control flow you can synchronize your commands with promise chaining 
 or the upcoming ES7 featur async/aait
