Javascript is asynchronous:
every javascript step return promise,
1. pending 2.resolved 3. rejected 
synchronous: you will move to the next step only after promise for the current step is either resolb=ve or rejected 
Asynchronous: Javascript moves to the next step even if a promise is pending 
90% (all the actions we perform in the of protractor API will not move to the next step until the promise is resolved 
if you want to retrieve anything from browser - then that particular functionality related methods have not support of promise resolving 

javascript element in protractor test are always asynchronous
